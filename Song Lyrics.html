                <p>
                    The club isn't the best place to find a lover<br>
                    So the bar is where I go (mm-mm)<br>
                    Me and my friends at the table doing shots<br>
                    Drinking fast, and then we talk slow (mm-mm)<br>
                    You come over and start up a conversation with just me<br>
                    And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (mm-mm)<br>
                    Take my hand, stop, put "Van the Man" on the jukebox<br>
                    And then we start to dance<br>
                    And now I'm singing like<br>
                    Girl, you know I want your love<br>
                    Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
                    Come on now, follow my lead<br>
                    I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
                    Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much<br>
                    Grab on my waist and put that body on me"<br>
                    Come on now, follow my lead<br>
                    Come, come on now, follow my lead<br>
                    (Mm-mm)<br>
                    I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
                    We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
                    Although my heart is falling too<br>
                    I'm in love with your body<br>
                    Last night you were in my room<br>
                    And now my bed sheets smell like you<br>
                    Every day discovering something brand new<br>
                    Oh, I'm in love with your body<br>
                    Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I<br>
                    Oh, I'm in love with your body<br>
                    Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I<br>
                    Oh, I'm in love with your body<br>
                    Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I<br>
                    Oh, I'm in love with your body<br>
                    Every day discovering something brand new<br>
                    I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
                    One week in we let the story begin<br>
                    We're going out on our first date (mm-mm)<br>
                    But you and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat<br>
                    Fill up your bag, and I fill up a plate (mm-mm)<br>
                    We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour<br>
                    And how your family is doing okay (mm-mm)<br>
                    And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the back seat<br>
                    Tell the driver make the radio play<br>
                    And I'm singing like<br>
                    Girl, you know I want your love<br>

                    Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much<br>
                    Grab on my waist and put that body on me"<br>
                    Come on now, follow my lead<br>
                    Come, come on now, follow my lead<br>
                    (Mm-mm)<br>
                    I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
                    We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
